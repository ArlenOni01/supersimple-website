	<p>Before the end of grade 5 in elementary school, I would wake up early to prepare my breakfast and pack my lunch, thus saving my parents the time to do those 
	things for me. I did this all through Middle School to the end of y High School years. This culminated in my real love of cooking which began when I would stay up 
	until very late at night just watching simple cooking videos and getting very intrigued with it as it was, to me, an art style. So when I came up with the idea of "Pangea",
	 I felt as though the best way to reach out to people would be through my food. Because after all, who doesn't love <b>FOOD!</b> My goal is to simply bring
	 flavors from all around the globe together into one restaurant similarly to the way pangea was once all of the world in one land mass. </p>
