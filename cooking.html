	<p>My love of cooking began when I would stay up until very late at night just watching simple cooking videos and getting very intrigued with 
	it as it was an art style. So when I came up with the idea of "Pangea", I felt as though the best way to reach out to people would be through my food. 
	Because after all, who doesn't love <b>FOOD!</b> My goal is to simply bring the flavors from all around the world together into one restaurant similarly to the way pangea was once 
	all of the world in one land mass. </p>
