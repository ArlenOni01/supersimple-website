	<h2> My Upbringing </h2>
	<p>
		As a kid my greatest passions in life had always been my friends, family, and of course soccer. Growing up in a small town in Yellowknife,
		Canada, my father and my brother naturally got me to develop the same love for soccer that my father gave my brother as they grew up in 
		Nigeria. I love to resonate with my Canadian side very much as I am the only one in my entire extended family who was born outside of Nigeria, 
		so I hold my Canadian citizenship very close to my heart.
	</p>
	<p>
		<h2> Adolescence </h2>
		As I moved from Canada to Australia at the age of 7, I was able to explore a completely different side of the world that I had not
		seen before. There were different types of people there in terms of the immigrants that they had and the natives that were there as well.  
		Despite my only living in Australia for less than 2 years, I really enjoyed and immersed myself with the culture that Australia had to offer, 
		whether it be with nature or their delicious food, being an honorary Australian for a year was definitely something I did not mind at all.
	</p>
	<p>
		Despite my living in other countries for the majority of my adolescence, I do believe that the United States has shaped me into the
		man that I am today. The friends that I have made in elementary, junior high, high school, college, and even at work have been some of the 
		greatest people I have ever met in my life. College has helped me discover my authentic self and the potential that I have to be the absolute
		best version of myself.
	</p>
	<h2> Life in College </h2>
	<p>
		During my freshman year in college at Texas Tech University, I realized while studying civil engineering that heavy construction engineering was not for me. My father
		is an engineer and so is my brother and my sister so I figured that I should try it as well as I did not really give much thought as to what
		I should study in college. Most of my high school years, I believed that with my potential, playing division 1 soccer and then eventually 
		playing professional soccer was an idea that was not bizarre for me or to my friends and family around me, but when I realized that that dream 
		was fading away at the end of my senior year, I ended up quitting soccer altogether. It crushed me to feel as though I did not get the ending to my 
		soccer-playing career that I felt I deserved, and because of that, I fell into a heavy depressive state during my freshman year in college. This was when I discovered
		3 new things about myself: <b>1)</b> As I took an intro to computer science class, I realized I wanted to switch my major to computer science. 
		<b>2)</b> I wanted to play competitive soccer again to see if I could have some closure with the sport. <b>3)</b> I randomly discovered that 
		I had a hidden passion for cooking.
	</p>
	<p>
		Transferring to Concordia University Texas was one of the greatest decisions I ever made. While I may not be getting the education of 
		larger and more widely known schools, I believe that I am helping myself prepare for what I believe I want to do in my future. I believe that my purpose is to help people more than
		ever. Whether it be with great food, a fun video game that will help you escape reality, or even to help people feel safer online through 
		cyber security, my primary mission is to make an impact on the world for the better, but also in a very meaningful way.
