		Beginning my journey in Computer Science was quite a difficult one. It has been a challenge to find the right people to learn from online or
		in my general schooling. I have begun submerging myself into properly understanding how to program. With this project, I am learning HTML. In 
		college, I am primarily looking at Python. In the next section (Game Development), I will describe my experience with C# and the Unity gaming engine, and 
		currently, I am taking online courses through Udemy to understand C++ with a beginners course that I will be coupling with a course covering
		the basics of the Unreal Engine.
	<h2>Game Development</h2>
	<p>From my favorite video games, to video games I have made, I have a passion for gaming that I never really realized until 2020.</p>

		I began developing my own game in the summer of 2022 as a side project of mine. I wanted to be able to have something of some merit that was mine
		that was worth something related to the field that I want to go in to. Using the Unity engine, I coded a game in C# and used 2D tile-maps to 
		construct a dungeon-esque game where the objective of the game is to go around the map, solving riddles and defeating enemies. Once you have 
		solved all of the riddles, then you have beaten the game.
